# Diabetes-Prediction
Diabetes is one of the deadliest and chronic diseases. About one in seven U.S.
adults has diabetes now. By 2050, as many as one in three may become diabetic.
Many complications occur if diabetes remains untreated and unidentified.
Identifying patients who are at high-risk of becoming diabetic allows early medical
interventions.

In this project we are -

1. Building three types of models - Logistic Regression , Support Vetor Machines, Random Forest Classification and comparing their performance
2. Tuning the hyperparameters of random forest model using grid search
3. Generating insights on how should the patients be targeted
